# This is a simple example of an online store with various items.
This program is written as a package with four classes:
Computer, Oven Phone and Store.
In each separated class from the first three classes a concrete object is created. For example in a class "Computer" is created
an object "Computer", etc.
Class "Store" includes the main method which launches the whole program.
The program is written entirely in Java in the Intellij environment.
